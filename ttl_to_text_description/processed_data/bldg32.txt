Recommended Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs):
 - Convert CV systems to VAV systems for better efficiency.
 - Optimize cooling coil operation during low-load periods.
 - Implement load-based staging of RTUs to minimize energy demand during low-occupancy periods.
 - Adjust thermostat setpoints to align cooling schedules with office hours.
 - Operate economizers to leverage outdoor air for free cooling when conditions permit.
 - Optimize HVAC scheduling to match occupancy levels.
 - Upgrade BAS to improve zoning and control.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
 - Run Time Reduction: Measure total runtime of HVAC equipment.
 - Energy per Occupied Area: Track energy consumption (kWh) relative to building occupancy.
