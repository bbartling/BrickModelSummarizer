def solve_equation():
    # To solve the equation 8x + 7 = -23, we start by isolating the term with the variable x. Our first step is to eliminate the constant term on the side of the equation with the variable by performing the opposite operation. Here, 7 is added to 8x, so we'll subtract 7 from both sides of the equation to start isolating x.
    print('8x + 7 - 7 = -23 - 7')
    # After subtracting 7 from both sides, the equation simplifies. On the left side, 7 - 7 equals 0, leaving us with 8x. On the right side, -23 - 7 equals -30.
    print('8x = -30')
    # Now, we have 8x = -30. The final step to solve for x is to isolate x by dividing both sides of the equation by 8.
    print('x = -30 / 8')
    # Simplify the fraction -30 / 8 by finding the greatest common divisor of 30 and 8, which is 2, and divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2.
    print('x = -15 / 4')
    # Now the fraction is simplified and the solution is clearly expressed as a fraction.
    print('x = -3.75 or x = -15/4')

    print('Final Answer: x = -15/4')
